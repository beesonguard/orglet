# Orglet

A free org-mode viewer for Android with Git-native sync.

## Status

🚧 **Early Development** - Not yet usable

## What is Orglet?

Orglet is a mobile app for reading and navigating [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/) files. Unlike other org apps, Orglet:

- **Free to view** - No paywall just to read your files
- **Git-native** - Clone and pull from GitHub/GitLab directly
- **Built for reading** - Collapsible headings, reading position memory, clean typography

## Planned Features (MVP)

- [ ] Collapsible heading navigation
- [ ] GitHub/GitLab integration (clone, pull)
- [ ] Reading position persistence (works as a bookmark)
- [ ] In-file search
- [ ] Dark/light themes
- [ ] Offline support

## Why?

Existing org-mode mobile apps either:
- Cost money just to view files (Orgro: $5)
- Are abandoned (Orgzly)
- Don't support Git sync (most of them)

Orglet aims to be the free, Git-native alternative.

## Tech Stack

- React Native (TypeScript)
- isomorphic-git
- Android first, iOS later
